  "summary": "The diff implements most of the BuildRequest requirements including character replacement, login screen with Q key, and JJK Arena branding. However, the backend only includes 25 characters total (not spanning books 1-25 as stated), and some image mappings may be incomplete.",

      "requirement": "Backend contains Streets of Tyson characters spanning books 1-25",
      "reason": "The backend includes exactly 25 characters (Tyson, Peter, Dustin, Corey, Michael, Gary Math Teacher, Funny Bartender Joey, Rodney The Rat, The Fox, Hammerhead, Peter From The Pier, Smokin Guapo, The Boxer, The Snapper, Counterfeiter, Mighty Max, Black Panther, The Rooster, Thunder God, The Bulldog, Sheldon Slapper, Joey The Janitor, Mad Scientist, Bosco & Frisky, Doves), but there is no evidence these span across books 1-25 with distribution. The truncation prevents full verification, but the visible character list suggests the roster exists without clear book attribution.",
