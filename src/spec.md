# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a turn-based 2D game where Jujutsu Kaisen characters battle in a Culling Games arena with unique abilities and a points system.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a character selection screen with Yuji, Megumi, Nobara, and Maki
- Implement turn-based combat system with attack, defend, cursed technique, and special move actions
- Create combat UI with health bars, cursed energy meters, ability buttons, and turn indicators
- Design dark fantasy anime-inspired visual theme with dramatic lighting and bold contrasts
- Develop backend character data with unique stats and abilities for each fighter
- Implement Culling Games points system that awards points for defeating opponents
- Create arena battleground with atmospheric Jujutsu Kaisen theme

**User-visible outcome:** Players can select a Jujutsu Kaisen character, enter a Culling Games arena, and engage in turn-based combat using character-specific cursed techniques while tracking points earned from victories.
